# COMPLETED USER STORIES/BUGS BELOW ###########################################

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type: UserStory 2.1
Name: Add Ship models
Issue: we need 8 different SpaceShip models, 4 for each player(Just to add a bit
of extra visuals). Make sure all artwork is credited in the credit.text
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type: UserStory 2.2
Name: Map Ship models
Issue: Map each model with Pins so that we would be able to draw then on the screen
and check for collisions. Keep in mind that the Pins need to have a proper distance
from each other. At the moment the center of each pin is 50 unit away from the other
Pins, both on the X-axis and Y-axis.
