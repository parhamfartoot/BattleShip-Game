Battleship
===

A recreation of the world-renowned game, Battleship, using *java*.

A player has four ships to strategically place on their side of the game board. Players take turns firing shots at the opponent's pins. If a ship is placed on that pin, it is recorded as a *hit*. Otherwise, it is recorded as a *miss*. The objective of the game is to sink all of your opponent's ships.
